# Title: Which Approach is Better? — Evaluate String Solutions!

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# Two students, Aarav and Diya, solved the same problems
# using different approaches. Which solution is CLEANER,
# SHORTER, and EASIER to understand?
# Evaluate both and explain your reasoning!

  Both give the SAME result!
  → Diya's 'in' keyword is MORE READABLE (reads like English!)
  → Aarav's find() works but is more complex for a simple check.
  ✅ WINNER: 'in' keyword (for simple membership checks)
  📝 NOTE: Use find() when you also need the POSITION.

# REFLECTION:
# 1. When would you prefer find() over 'in'?
# 2. What other ways can user input be "messy" to handle?
