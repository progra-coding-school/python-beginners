# Program Code: STR-LR-02
# Title: String Detective — Find the Hidden Pattern!
# Cognitive Skill: Logical Reasoning (Pattern recognition)
# Topic: Strings in Python

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
# Diya has hidden secret messages inside strings.
# Use your string skills to decode the patterns and
# figure out what the output will be — without running the code first!

# REFLECTION:
# 1. Why did 'diya' (lowercase) return False in Clue 4?
# 2. What pattern did you use to solve the slice in Clue 5?
# 3. Create your own string detective clue for a classmate!
