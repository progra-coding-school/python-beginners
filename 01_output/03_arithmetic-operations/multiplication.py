# print is a built-in function used to display output.
# Note: we are using *, the Python multiplication operator, not the mathematical multiplication symbol.
# The * operator means multiplication.
# So Python multiplies 10 by 4, which equals 40.
# print() displays that result on the screen
print(10 * 4)
