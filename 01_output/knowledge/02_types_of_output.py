# Title: Types of Output
# Cognitive Skill: Knowledge
# Topic: Output in Python

# Python can output different types of data using print().

# --- Type 1: Text (String) ---
print("Hello, I am Diya!")
print('My favourite sport is cricket.')

# --- Type 2: Whole Numbers (Integer) ---
print(42)
print(2024)
print(0)

# --- Type 3: Decimal Numbers (Float) ---
print(3.14)
print(9.99)
print(0.5)

# --- Type 4: Arithmetic Results ---
print(10 + 5)       # Addition → 15
print(20 - 8)       # Subtraction → 12
print(6 * 7)        # Multiplication → 42
print(15 / 4)       # Division → 3.75
print(15 // 4)      # Floor division → 3
print(15 % 4)       # Remainder → 3
print(2 ** 8)       # Power → 256

# --- Type 5: Text + Numbers together (with comma) ---
print("Age:", 13)
print("Score:", 95)
print("Pi is approximately", 3.14159)

# --- Type 6: Multiple items (separated by comma) ---
print("Name:", "Aarav", "Age:", 13, "Grade:", 7)
# comma adds a space between each item automatically

# --- Type 7: Repeating text ---
print("=" * 30)     # prints = thirty times
print("Ha" * 5)     # HaHaHaHaHa

# Think:
# 1. What is the difference between print(5+5) and print("5+5")?
# 2. What does print("*" * 10) display?
